# ImageClassifier

The approach here uses Keras, which is emerging as the best library for building neural networks. The code here also assumes you are using Tensorflow as the underlying library (it wonâ€™t run properly if you are using Theano). 

# How to run it 
Just clone the repository, Go into the project folder and click on the index.html , it will automatically run the code.
